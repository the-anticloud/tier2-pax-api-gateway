## What this project is

PAX API Gateway is an OpenAI-compatible API server that wraps all PAX inference and reasoning engines, providing a standard interface for any client expecting OpenAI's chat completions, embeddings, or completion APIs.

**Scope honesty:** no model decoding path ships in this project. It is a deterministic/offline component with AIOSS-style audit wiring. PAX may call it as a tool; no inference is claimed here.

## Install

```bash
# No executable package manifest was detected in this project.
# This repository ships documentation, evidence and licence material.
# See docs/ for the full handoff package.
```

Detected stack: docs-only

## Evidence and measured results

**NOT MEASURED.** No results file in this project carries both a value and run provenance (commit or date), so no benchmark number is claimed here. This is deliberate: Anticloud FZ LLE does not publish unmeasured scores.

## Millennium problem proposals

This project packages Anticloud Millennium problem proposals: P01, P02, P03, P04, P05, P06, P07, P08, P09, P10, P11, P12, P13, P14.

Proposals are shipped as PDFs under `25_MILLENNIUM_PROBLEM_PROPOSALS/` in the internal handoff tree and summarised in `docs/`.
