## Company Purpose

Anticloud FZ LLE builds sovereign AI infrastructure that enterprises and governments own outright — not rent. PAX L5 Narrow L2 General 27B is the flagship: a 27B-parameter model at $0.08 per million tokens with SHA3-256 cryptographic audit chains, full air-gap capability, and MITRE ATT&CK 100/100, deployed as a single binary on commodity hardware with zero cloud dependency.

**Pax Api Gateway** is the API gateway layer exposing PAX with per-request AIOSS cryptographic receipts.

## The Problem

The $28B regulated AI market cannot use cloud AI. HIPAA prohibits routing patient data through external APIs. FedRAMP requires air-gap capability. PCI-DSS 4.0 mandates cryptographic audit chains. UAE data residency law forbids cloud endpoints for government workloads. GPT-4 costs $60/1M tokens, provides zero cryptographic proof, and is architecturally illegal for regulated use. No frontier lab has solved this — their business model requires cloud routing.

## The Solution

| Metric | PAX L5/L2 27B | GPT-4 | Advantage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cost / 1M tokens | **$0.08** | $60 | **750×** |
| TruthfulQA | **61.86%** | 59% | +2.86pp |
| MITRE ATT&CK | **100/100** | Not published | Only published score |
| Air-gap | **✓ Full** | ✗ | Compliance-enabling |
| Audit chain | **✓ SHA3-256** | ✗ | HIPAA/FedRAMP required |
| Hardware req. | **T4 16GB** | H100 cluster | Commodity |

## Why Now

1. **Regulatory acceleration** — GDPR enforcement doubled 2024–2026. UAE AI law effective Q1 2026. FedRAMP Moderate now mandatory for all federal AI procurement.
2. **Hardware democratization** — T4 GPUs at $0.40/hr. 27B models run on hardware regulated enterprises already own.
3. **Post-Schrems II certainty** — EU enterprises have legal certainty that US cloud AI violates GDPR.
4. **Model capability inflection** — 27B Q4 models now reach L2 General (50th–90th percentile) for regulated tasks.

## Market

**TAM: $28B** — regulated AI (healthcare, government, finance, defense)
**SAM: $4.2B** — enterprises with GPU infrastructure + active compliance requirements
**SOM: $180M** — Year 3 target, GCC + EU + US federal
